## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. User Management & Authentication - Required for production use
2. Dashboard Page - Key for monitoring
3. Audit Logs Page - Required for compliance

### Medium Priority (Advanced Features)
4. Schema Management - Important for data governance
5. Broker Token Management - Security requirement
6. Message Browser UI - Debugging capability

### Lower Priority (Enterprise Features)
7. Functions/Sources/Sinks - For Pulsar Functions users
8. Namespace Isolation Policies - Advanced cluster management
9. Resource Quotas - Capacity planning
10. Bookkeeper Management - Deep cluster monitoring

## Property Tests Not Implemented

All 54 property tests from the Kiro spec are not implemented:
- Core Management: 13 properties
- Message Browsing: 5 properties
- Monitoring & Statistics: 10 properties
- Audit & Observability: 14 properties
- Resilience: 8 properties
- Export: 4 properties

These tests ensure correctness properties like:
- Credential encryption at rest
- Tenant/namespace/topic name validation
- Cache invalidation on mutations
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Audit event completeness
- Transaction rollback on error
